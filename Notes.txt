Questions to answer:

- Relationship between critics reviews and results
- Seasonality stuff
- Are international films relaeased differently?
- Which movies are most reviewed critically? By users? Anything
  stand out in this?



Things to remember:

- Inflation adjustment
- Currency differences...
- Fudged budget numbers
- Genre is alphabetical - not primary, secondary, tertiary


Approach for getting genre broken out
- Convert genre column to lists
- Make three columns for genre1, genre2, genre3 
    - Could list comp this?


Hypotheses for testing:

1. Prime v not prime
    - H[0] = No difference between prime and gen pop
    - H[A] = There is a difference (probably that prime is better,
    i.e. a right tailed test)
2. Competitors matter
    - Harder to say what the hypothese are here
    - Believe that more than average and less than average have an
    effect
    - Does this turn into 2 hypothesis tests? Do I test more than one
    set of thresholds for what is high or low? 
    - Seems to me that comparing all of them would create a situation
    where it would be very hard to get a significant result. Maybe grouping 
    them would be better. I could group by 1 or 2 sds out?
        - Would need to get the SD from a group by release week and release
        year to get rid of double-counting
        - Ask about this in the morning
